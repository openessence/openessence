## openessence.io, why ?

There are 3 key reasons why [openessence.io](http://openessence,io) exists as a project:

1. To capture how things are done, not just what they might produce. Organisations are as interested in the approach as much as they are in the product; they want to reproduce things.
2. To ensure consistency of use and reuse to wide audience, in particular that activities can be used across different parts of an organisation
3. To provoke discussion on ways of working and culture within a technology organisation, partly to discuss whether a practice library is a viable approach in a technical organisation.

## Objectives

In the short term the aim is to record activities and techniques (see Terminology below) from within different organisations, with some structure in terms of layout.

- short term : to record different activities and techniques.
- medium term : categorise the activities and techniques using a number of different methods.
- longer term : devise different means of accessing and contributing to the practice library.

## Outputs

openessence.io is an upstream project and as such may not have a branded, polished
