Some basic terminology for OpenEssence:

Technique : a session or piece of work that can be used as part of a bigger activity. Techniques themselves may not advance or measure the project you are working on, but form part of the process. An example of a technique would be something like a 9 Block Model or Design Thinking. 

Activity : a piece of work that advances a project from one state to another state and has measurable impact. For example, this measurement might be done using Alpha State Cards, which are part of [SEMAT Essence](http://www.semat.org). Activities are generic and not specific to a single technology or paradigm. An example of an activity would be Stakeholder mapping. 

Practice : an application of a series of activities to an organisation or directed piece of work. Activities would normally be part of multiple practices. An example of a practice would be Red Hat Consulting or Open Innovation Lab.
