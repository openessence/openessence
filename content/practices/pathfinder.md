## What is Pathfinder?

Pathfinder is a web based application assessment tool which is used by customers to determine which applications could be containerised, the effort involved and any impediments to the containerisation process.

Pathfinder enables customers to view the order in which applications should be migrated as well as help determine the type of work involved e.g migrate, modernise etc,  and a course estimate of the effort required.
