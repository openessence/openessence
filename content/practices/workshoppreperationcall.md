## What is a Workshop Preparation Call?

This is an activity that is designed as a precursor to an Architectural Workshop, such as the [Infrastructure Architecture Workshop](infrastructure-architecture-workshop.md). The outputs from the call are:

* A list of identified stakeholders and their areas of interest
* An agenda of workshops, with each workshop identified by subject matter and attendees

## Why use it?

The workshop preparation call should be used to set the agenda and scope of one or more workshops. Workshops are typically of the following types:

* Discovery Workshops - to understand the AS-IS situation.
* Requirements Workshops - to understand the TO-BE situation.
* Architectural Elaboration Workshops - to collaboratively design an architecture that addresses the customers requirements.

## Related Activities

The Workshop Preparation Call is a sub-activity of the following activities:

* [Infrastructure Architecture Workshop](infrastructure-architecture-workshop.md)

### From the Customer:
* Product Owner

2. Explain the purpose of the call: to create an agenda for the Architectural Workshop
3. Asks the Solution Provider Architect to list the workshops that she thinks are required. See [below](#Workshops-Required) for typical workshops that are required for the majority of projects.
4. Determine the number and subject are of workshops that need to be run.
5. Determine the participants required to attend each workshop.

### Workshops Required

The workshops required vary depending on the type of project being delivered by typically fall into the following classes:

1. Requirements workshop(s) attended by the Solution Provider Architect, the Product Owner and Customer Architects. Requirements workshops will usually focus on functional requirements, AS-IS and TO-BE.
2. Non-functional requirements workshops attended by the Solution Provider Architect, and Customer Subject Matter Experts in e.g. security, networking, storage, virtualisation. These workshops are to capture requirements in addition to the primary functional requirements of the solution.
3. Architecture Elaboration workshops. These follow on from the requirements workshops and allow the Solution Provider Architect to describe an initial architecture which addresses customer requirements, and discuss it with stakeholders.
