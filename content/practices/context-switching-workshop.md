## What is Content Switching?

Context Switching can be described as multi-tasking which is often seen as a good thing.  Unfortunately, we are not able to generate the same amount of output/value when we multi-task.

Much recent neuroscience research tells us that the brain doesn’t really do tasks simultaneously, as we thought (hoped) it might. In fact, we just switch tasks quickly. Each time we move from hearing music to writing a text or talking to someone, there is a stop/start process that goes on in the brain.

That start/stop/start process is rough on us: rather than saving time, it costs time (even very small micro seconds), it’s less efficient, we make more mistakes, and over time it can be energy sapping.

Picture the scene: you are working on Project A but your manager comes over to your desk as says you need to do some more work on Project B.  Being a compliant person, you agree and start working on Project B although you only completed 50% of the work assigned to you in Project A. A day later, another manager approaches you and says that Project C is now your highest priority and you must drop everything you're doing and focus on Project C.

How do you demonstrate to your management team that this is a bad idea? Run this workshop with them!

## Why use  it?
This workshop will demonstrate the adverse effects of context switching.

## Who do you need?

- 1 Facilitator and > 10 participants.


## Suggested Time

- 1 hour


## Difficulty
- Facilitator: Easy
- Participants: Easy


## Facilitation Materials Needed

- Whiteboard, marker and a stopwatch.

## Delivery
Prepare a whiteboard similar to the image below:

![Whiteboard](/images/context-switch.jpg)

Get everybody to stand in a circle and describe the 'rules'.  You are going to go around the room in turn and everybody will say the next item in the sequence. The first 3 are simple mathematics (2, 5 and 7 times table) and the last two are alphabetical (A to Z then Z to A)
