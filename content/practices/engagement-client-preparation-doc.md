## What is a Client Preparation Document

It's a document that maps out the prerequisites for a Discovery Session or other presales workshop. It ensures that all the key elements needed are actually in place prior to the
meeting taking place.  

The Document should be sourced around a particular theme, then edited to reflect customer details and passed on to the customer. It should outline a framework agenda for discussion and finalisation in the Pre-Call as well as potential outcomes from the one day Discovery Session.
The document should be sent in pdf format and used for follow on finalisation of an on-site Discovery Session.
See following link for an example SOE Client prep doc.
When creating additional solution themes a client prep doc should be a mandatory document and created to introduce the solutions Discovery Session practice.    

## Why use  it?

To ensure everything needed proir to a Discovery Session or other similar activity is in place. It's an aide memoir and a template for running an engagement.
