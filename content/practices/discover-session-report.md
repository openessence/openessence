## What is a Discovery Session Report ?

Short report template for Discovery Sessions. The problem with some discovery sessions is that the documentation takes too long to produce and can be too extensive. Using templates ensures a succinct, easy to read report with the key findings.

A Discovery Session usually last for 1 day or less and the report should be written with this in mind; it should be short, concise and relevant to the workshop.

## Why use  it?

Use the template for the report to avoid spending too much time and effort creating a report that is bespoke and too long.
