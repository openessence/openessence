## What is the Open Decision Framework ?

For the past few years Red Hat, have been grappling with the challenges of growing an open organization and sustaining our culture along the way. One tool weâ€™ve been developing and testing is the Open Decision Framework, a collection of best practices for applying open source principles to business projects and decisions.

The Open Decision Framework contains the collective wisdom of an organisations staff, compiled into a flexible framework that helps decision makers and leaders seek out diverse perspectives and collaborate across teams and geos, to make better decisions.
