      <description>Virtual hackathon The very first openessence.io hackathon will take place during 27/28th June 2018 with the aim of creating a range of content for the openessence.io practice library. This will be a range of activities and techniques that are used when working with open source software and projects.
The aim of this first hackathon is to neatly capture what we do as a series of activities and techniques, so that they can then be catalogued and reviewed as the first part of the openessence.</description>

The Schneider Model identifies the primary, underlying culture which shapes the organisation. There are 4 main types: - Control - Cultivation - Collaboration - Competence</description>
